# Machine Learning NanoDegree Projects

As part of the [MLND program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009), I've run a set of projects aiming to learn machine learning by building and applying predictive models to massive data.

I have developed a skill set that allows me to develop machines and systems that automatically improve. I have built, evaluated, and optimized machine learning models including classification, regression, clustering, and recommendation using the most efficient Python libraries for machine learning such as [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), but also the open-source library [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for deep learning.


The following projects goes from the prediction of housing prices using linear regression techniques, to the training of a smartcab to drive by itself using a reinforcement learning model.
